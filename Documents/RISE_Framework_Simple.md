# RISE Technology Hub Framework
## Simple Cost-Plus Model

**Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** January 2026 | **Status:** Pending Approval

---

## WHAT IS THIS?

RISE becomes NH's central technology buyer. Instead of 5 entities buying separately, RISE buys for everyone.

**The Deal:**
```
Entity pays = Vendor cost + X% margin
```

**Example:**
- Dell charges RISE: AED 100,000
- RISE margin (5%): AED 5,000  
- Entity pays: **AED 105,000**

**Transparency:** Entity sees Dell's quote, Dell's invoice, and the 5% calculation. No hidden fees.

---

## WHY DO THIS?

| Problem Now | RISE Solution |
|-------------|---------------|
| Each entity negotiates alone | Combined buying power |
| Weak pricing | Better vendor deals |
| No tech expertise | Expert validation |
| Manual overhead | Centralized efficiency |

**Net Cost:** X% margin, but offset by better pricing + reduced overhead

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### Simple 4 Steps:

1. **Entity needs technology** → Emails RISE
2. **RISE gets vendor quotes** → Shows entity (e.g., Dell AED 50K)
3. **Entity approves** → Issues PO to RISE (AED 52,500 with 5% margin)
4. **RISE orders & delivers** → Entity pays RISE

### First Month Setup:

- Each entity lists technology needs (servers, laptops, software, etc.)
- RISE confirms "we can handle this" or "we can't"
- Approved items = RISE-exclusive
- Declined items = entity buys independently

---

## THE RULES

### Entities CANNOT (for RISE-approved items):
❌ Contact vendors directly  
❌ Get their own quotes  
❌ Issue POs to vendors  

### Entities CAN:
✅ Buy what RISE declined  
✅ Add new categories (1-month notice)  
✅ Bypass RISE if SLA fails  

### Violations:
1st = Warning | 2nd = CIO meeting | 3rd = Removed from framework

---

## RISE MUST DELIVER

### Response Times:
| Type | Response | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Critical | 2 hours | Server down |
| Urgent | 4 hours | Security issue |
| Normal | 8 hours | Need laptops |

### Monthly Targets:
- 95% SLA compliance
- 98% quote accuracy  
- 4.0/5.0 entity satisfaction

### If RISE Fails:
Month 1 below 90% = Warning  
Month 2 below 90% = Review  
Month 3 below 90% = Termination

---

## CONTROLS & OVERSIGHT

### NH Audits:
- Random checks: 10 transactions/month
- Full audit: Quarterly
- Any transaction: Anytime

### If Overcharging Found:
- Refund within 7 days
- 3+ errors = Framework review

### Governance:
- **Monthly:** NH IT + RISE performance review
- **Quarterly:** Steering committee (CIO, entities, RISE, Finance)
- **Annual:** Contract renewal decision

---

## EXIT STRATEGY

### NH Can Terminate:
- Performance failure (3 months <90%)
- Pricing fraud
- Entity dissatisfaction
- Strategic change (90-day notice)
- **Anytime for any reason**

### Exit Protection:
✅ Zero penalties  
✅ Zero minimum commitment  
✅ All vendors transfer to NH  
✅ RISE pays transition costs  

### 90-Day Exit:
Days 1-30: Get vendor contacts  
Days 30-60: Knowledge transfer  
Days 60-90: Complete orders  
Day 90: Done

---

## KEY RISKS

| Risk | Solution |
|------|----------|
| RISE too slow | Strict SLAs + bypass option |
| Price manipulation | Mandatory audits |
| Poor service | Termination rights |
| NH locked in | Zero exit penalties |

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

**Months 2-4:** Pilot with 1-2 entities  
**Month 5+:** Full rollout
