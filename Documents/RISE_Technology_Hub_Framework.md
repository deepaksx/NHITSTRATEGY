# RISE Technologies LLC - Technology Hub Framework
## Strategic Evaluation & Engagement Model for NH Group

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Classification:** Internal - Strategic  
**Owner:** NH IT Department

---

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes a structured, risk-mitigated approach for evaluating RISE Technologies LLC's potential role as the centralized technology procurement and service management hub for NH Group entities. The framework implements a phased approach with clear go/no-go decision gates, objective performance criteria, and defined exit strategies to protect NH Group interests.

**Key Principles:**
- Evidence-based evaluation before commitment
- Probationary period with strict SLA monitoring
- Performance-based continuation with quarterly reviews
- Clear exit strategy with no financial penalty to NH
- Protection of entity autonomy and operational continuity

---

## 1. PROPOSED OPERATING MODEL

### 1.1 RISE's Intended Role

**As Technology Hub, RISE would:**
- Act as single point of contact for all NH entities' technology needs
- Source technology solutions, products, and services from market vendors
- Manage vendor relationships, contracts, and negotiations
- Handle AMC (Annual Maintenance Contracts), renewals, and escalations
- Coordinate technical support and service delivery
- Process all technology procurement through RISE (Entity → RISE → Vendor)

**Revenue Model:**
- Commission on initial software/product/service acquisition
- Annual commission on AMC and maintenance contracts
- Service fee for contract management and vendor coordination

### 1.2 Value Proposition (If Successful)

**Potential Benefits:**
- Centralized vendor management and negotiation power
- Standardized procurement processes across group
- Consolidated contract management
- Single escalation point for technical issues
- Potential cost savings through volume negotiations

**Potential Risks:**
- Additional bureaucratic layer slowing decision-making
- Lack of technical expertise to evaluate solutions
- Poor vendor management impacting service delivery
- Entity dissatisfaction with centralized model
- RISE becoming bottleneck for critical technology needs

| **AMC Already Paid** | Pro-rated commission for service period |
| **Future AMC** | No commission; transferred to entity/NH |
| **Handover Quality** | 10-20% of final payment contingent on complete handover |

**Holdback:**
- NH retains 20% of final settlement for 90 days post-termination
- Released after verification of complete handover
- Adjusted for any post-termination issues discovered

### 5.4 Post-Termination Support

**Optional Transition Support (if RISE agrees):**
