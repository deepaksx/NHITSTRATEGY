3. **Keep It Simple** - Avoid IT jargon; use business language
4. **Show ROI** - Link every initiative to business impact (cost savings, risk reduction, revenue enablement)
5. **Be Realistic** - Don't overpromise; you're already 3-6 months behind
6. **One Version of Truth** - Single document, version controlled
7. **Make It Actionable** - Every section should lead to a decision or action
